# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
## It's a simple Feedforward Neural Network implemented just using Numpy library. :smiley:

* Libraries:
  * Numpy: Matrix calculation and most of the code !!!.
  * Tensorflow: Dataset (MNIST).
  * Matplotlib: Sample Image Display.

* Files:
  * archi.py: Contains the basic architecture of Layer(Dense) and Model.
  * test.py: Contains the sample test used on MNIST dataset.

* Note:
  * You can change the architecture of the model other than that used in test.py.:thumbsup:
  * Also can use a different datatset but remember the dimensions.
    * x_train: (no_examples, features)
    * y_train: (no_examples, target)

* Architecture of the model must be a list of dictionary containing values of no of units in the layer and activation function.
* test.py already has converted one-hot encoding for MNIST you may use your knowledge and change it according to your dataset.
